  <h2>About us</h2>
  <p>As the name suggests, Ping Pong Pizza is a pizzaria that was founded not too long ago. Our founder, Rodney, had always wanted to start his own pizzaria, but didn't have the money to do so. He started a small tech company 10 years ago that he recently sold to Facebook for a modest sum and decided now was the time to pursue his childhood dreams. Our restaurant is focused on family experiences while serving quality pizza at a reasonable price. It is also because of our dedication to family experiences that we don't do delivery. A few of our side attractions include an arcade and play area for kids.</p>
